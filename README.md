Several projects made in 2018-2019. 

**1_ Semaine Observatoire (OHP)** is the work made with two other students during a week at the _Observatoire de Haute Provences_"_ (OHP). It contains the data taken, a useful article and the report made "Étude photométrique de l’amas ouvert NGC 1245" (sadly, in French).  

**8_ Projet Numérique (PN)** is a project made with a scientist from the CRAL. There wasn't any specificly allocated time for this project and was done along the other courses and exams from **insert date** to **insert date**. My project was under the supervision of Jeremy Blaizot and Joakim Rosdhal and consisted in developing a __2D hydrodynamical code__ in __Fortran__ and apply it to the modelling of a supernova. It was successfully done. This folder contains the source code for the simulation (_Code_), some useful courses for the project (_Cours_), videos of the simulation (_Vidéos_) and slides (_Présentation.*_) as this was judged by an oral exam.  

**9_Cours Python** contains the work made for an evaluated project. The instructions were to do something in __Python__ in __1 day__ that could be judged. So I made a __Matrix rain__ with several add-ons. The result at the end of the project is the script Matrix_v1.6.0.py and needs to be launched alongside VarMatrix.py.   
Afterwards I improved it a bit by shifting the logic of the script to make it faster. This corresponds Matrix_v2.0.py (still in dev)s and needs to be launched with VarMatrix2.py.  

**12_Thèses/Anna_Pillepich** corresponds to two small exercises made "to check whether [one] can be a good match for the group and position". They are both done on the same jupyter file.
1. plot the stellar mass - total halo mass relation of galaxies at z=0: scatter plot (one dot one galaxy) + a running median in bins of halo mass.  
2. visualize the stellar mass density in projection of a galaxy from one of the TNG runs.
