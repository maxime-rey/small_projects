# small_projects
Several projects made in 2018-2019. 

1_ Semaine Observatoire (OHP) is the work made with two other students during a week at the _Observatoire de Haute Provences_"_ (OHP). It contains the data taken a useful article and the report made (sadly, in French).  

8_ Projet Numérique (PN) is a project made with a scientist from the CRAL. There wasn't any specificly allocated time for this project and was done along the other courses and exams from **insert date** to the **insert date**. My project was under the supervision of Jeremy Blaizot and Joakim Rosdhal and consisted in developping a 2D hydrodynamical code in Fortran and apply it to the modelling of a supernova. It was successfuly done. This folder contains some exercise which had to be done by all students before the begining of the project (_Ana Palacios_), the source code for the simulation (_Code_), some useful documentation (_Cours_), videos of the simulation (_Vidéos_) and slides (_Présentation *_) as this was judged by an oral exam.  

9_Cours Python contains things made during an week of Python courses. There are exercises from the course (_Exos Copin_), the course (_Cours Copin_) and the rest concerns a an evaluated project. The instructions were to do something in Python in 1 day that could be judged. So I made a Matrix rain with several add-ons. The results is Matrix_v1.6.0.py and needs to be launched alongside VarMatrix.py.   
Afterwards I improved it a bit by shifting the logic of the script to make it faster. This is Matrix_v2.0.py and needs to be launched with VarMatrix2.py.  

12_Thèses/Anna_Pillepich corresponds to small exercises made to "to check whether [one] can be a good match for the group and position".
